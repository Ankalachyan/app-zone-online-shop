  text:`A startup is a company that's in the initial stages of business.
  Founders normally finance their startups and may attempt to attract outside
  investment before they get off the ground. Funding sources include
  family and friends, venture capitalists, crowdfunding, and loans.
  Many startups turn to others for more funding, including family, friends,
  and venture capitalists. Silicon Valley is known for its strong venture
  capitalist community and is a popular destination for startups, but is
  also widely considered the most demanding arena.
  Startups can use seed capital to invest in research and to develop
  their business plans. Market research helps determine the demand for
  a product or service, while a comprehensive business plan outlines the
  company's mission statement, vision, and goals, as well as management
  and marketing strategies.`
